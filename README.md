##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
There are a few problems here:

- Please refer to the [Milestone 1 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/) and create the proper directory structure and file naming convention for this project. (See Objective steps 4 and 5.)

- Your code gets a little sloppy between lines 9 and 16. Each paragraph should be enclosed in a &lt;p&gt; tag, and then you would not need to use &lt;br&gt; tags to manually create line breaks.

- Add a &lt;title&gt; to your &lt;head&gt; tag.

I see that your purpose is generally defined (a personal portfolio for business/employment purposes), but I'd like to see a little more organization here. 

Your PWP Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

## Milestone 2 Feeback
Great job on Milestone 2. Awesome Bootstrap! Nice to see you digging into the framework, and aside from a few extra closing tags, your HTML looks good. Be careful of copy-pasta though. Your Milestone 2 passes, but please fix the directory structure ASAP (see note below). Go ahead and started on Milestone 3 before staring development.

### Suggestions
- Please re-do your directory stucture. Talk with me if you have any questions. See the [Milestone 1 documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/) for instructions.
- If time is running short (which it probably will!), the landing page can be cut I think. Then you will only have the 3 essential pages.
